# 📘 Copy Constructor in C#

A **Copy Constructor** in C# is a user-defined constructor that creates a **new object by copying the values** of an existing object.  
It helps in creating **duplicate objects** without affecting the original memory reference.

## 🚀 Features Covered
- Parameterized Constructor  
- Copy Constructor  
- Object Duplication  
- Display Method  
- Demonstration with Multiple Objects

## 📌 What is a Copy Constructor?

A **copy constructor** is a special type of constructor that accepts an **object of the same class** and copies its data into a new object.

---

## 🎯 Why Do We Use Copy Constructor?
- To duplicate an existing object  
- To keep original data safe  
- To avoid reference issues  
- To implement custom copy logic  
- Useful in cloning and immutability concepts  

---

## 🧠 Simple Concept

```
Original Object  →  Copy Constructor  →  New Object
```

Both objects have the **same values**, but they are stored in **different memory locations**.

---

## 💡 Key Points
- C# does **not** provide a built-in copy constructor  
- We define it manually  
- Helps avoid accidental modifications  
- Used for both **shallow copy** and **deep copy** patterns  
- Important concept in OOP and interviews

## 🛠 Output Example
```
Name is: Parth, Age is: 25
Name is: Parth, Age is: 25
```

## 🎯 Interview Notes
- A copy constructor takes an **object of the same class**  
- It copies all values (fields/properties)  
- It is **user-defined** in C#  
- Helps create separate objects with identical data  
- Prevents issues caused by reference assignments

## 🏁 Summary

Copy Constructor =  
**A constructor that creates a new object by copying another object of the same class.**

Useful for:  
✔ Cloning  
✔ Data protection  
✔ Custom copying  
✔ Avoiding reference problems
